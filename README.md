# Hello 👋

I'm Paprota, a Full-Stack Software Engineer. 
I have been enjoying problem-solving since I was a kid and thought that programming would suit my interest.
Initially, I thought I would become a frontend developer, but I've since developed a stronger preference for backend development.
I'm looking to expand my abilities and work with others on projects that bring value.
