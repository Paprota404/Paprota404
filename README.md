# Hello 👋

I'm Paprota, a Full-Stack software engineer. 
I have been enjoying problem-solving since I was a kid and thought that programming would suit my interest.
Initially, I thought I would become a frontend developer, but I've since developed a stronger preference for backend development.
I'm looking to expand my abilities and work with others on projects that bring value.

## 🚀 About Me

- A real-time communicator: [https://directme-eta.vercel.app/](#) - Because azure cold start, signing up and logging in may take a while
- An E-commerce store: [https://audiophile-e-commerce-site.vercel.app/](#)
